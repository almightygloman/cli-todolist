Command Line Interface To Do List

!trying to do as much as i can from scratch.

*Tasks:
-tasks are to be checked off as on a normal to do list
-tasks contain information on: due date, priority, description, progress made on task, & unique id
-due date has to parse a string input to a comparable date to sort tasks by date
-priority holds an integer to also aid in sorting tasks
-description contains a multiline string that will be saved as a .txt file
-progress holds an integer to display if a task has been started, not started or completed
-will have to generate a unique id for each tash created
